        <h4>In a world where everyone has their own busy schedules, struggles, and happenings in life, an investigation into the allocation of our time among different facets of our social existence becomes not only relevant but crucial. The distribution of time among the different people we spend with in our lives like our family, partner, friends, and even ourselves unveils profound insights into the dynamics of our relationships. 
            <br> <br>This paper shows the amount of time (in minutes) we spend with these different people. This covers how we spend time with family, friends, romantic partners, and alone. The objective is to help individuals recognize that hectic lifestyles and personal challenges can lead to the absence of meaningful moments with our dear ones.
        <br> <br>The information is sourced from "Our World in Data" and illustrates the average amount of time that people in the United States typically spend with others between the ages of 15 and 75.
