            The responses we got were mostly predictable given that, in life, we spend time 
            mostly with people around us during a certain time in our lives. It also depends on where 
            the person is currently in life and their situation. <br> <br>
            During the age range of 15–23, time is mostly spent with family, but as time passes, 
            it’s mostly spent alone. Given that, at that age, most students have their own priorities, 
            Many are still exploring what they want in life. At the age of 24-59, adulthood is a major 
            factor in why time is also mostly spent alone. After retirement, or during the age of 60 
            and above, time is mostly spent alone or with a partner, as during this time, spending 
            time alone or with a partner allows many to rest and relax after working for so long. <br><br>
            In the data we collected, it states that time is mostly spent alone in life. Regardless of 
            why we spend it that way, this explains how self-reliant one can be. Spending time alone 
            teaches us to become mindful and aware of what we have, thus allowing us to 
            appreciate more things in life. Considering how stressful life may be, spending time 
            allows us to recharge and release stress. Though we tend to spend most of our time 
            alone, that doesn’t mean that it is also self-isolation or loneliness. Giving ourselves most 
            of the time we have is one of the best things in life that will help us grow. As well as 
            balancing our time with family, friends, and partners, as each one has a great influence 
            on who and where we are in the present time
